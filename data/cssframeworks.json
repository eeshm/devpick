    "detailed_description": "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to speed up the development process by offering low-level utility classes for styling elements directly in the markup. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, Tailwind doesn’t come with predefined components. Instead, it provides the building blocks to create custom designs without writing custom CSS. It supports responsive design, dark mode, and modern features like JIT compilation and theming. Developers use it extensively in modern front-end stacks, especially with React, Vue, and Next.js. The ecosystem includes plugins, themes, UI libraries (like Tailwind UI), and integrations with major frameworks. Its popularity has skyrocketed thanks to its flexibility, strong documentation, and vibrant community. While beginners can adopt it quickly, understanding atomic class composition and design principles may take time.",
