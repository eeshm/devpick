    "detailed_description": "React is a declarative, component-driven JavaScript library developed by Meta (Facebook) for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. Its core feature—component-based architecture—enables reusable and modular code. JSX syntax makes templating seamless and intuitive for developers familiar with HTML and JavaScript. React is backed by a vast ecosystem: React Router for routing, Redux and Context API for state management, and tools like Next.js for server-side rendering. Its unidirectional data flow simplifies debugging and makes apps more predictable. React’s popularity stems from its extensive documentation, large community, and job demand. While beginners can grasp the basics quickly, mastering advanced concepts like hooks, context, and performance optimization requires time. React is ideal for dynamic, scalable frontend apps and is widely used by startups and tech giants alike.",
