    "detailed_description": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Built on the high-performance V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome, Node.js is designed for building scalable and fast network applications. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it ideal for real-time applications like chat systems and collaborative tools. One of its greatest strengths is the vast npm ecosystem, which provides thousands of reusable packages and modules. Node.js is commonly used in full-stack JavaScript environments alongside frontend frameworks like React or Angular. It's widely supported in the developer community and powers major platforms like Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber. However, it can struggle with CPU-intensive tasks and requires careful architecture to manage asynchronous code effectively. For developers familiar with JavaScript, it offers a relatively smooth learning curve and rapid development experience.",
